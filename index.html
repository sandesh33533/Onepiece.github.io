        <h1 style="color: gold; text-align: center">Usopp</h1>
        <h2>
          Usopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly
          hair, prominent lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion
          to Pinocchio (a wooden boy from a story of the same name who possessed
          a nose that would stretch after he lied). Usopp inherited his famous
          nose from his mother, while the rest of his face closely resembles his
          father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in the Boin
          Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Like the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the
          majority of the series before wearing different clothing by the end of
          the Paradise. Usopp usually wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue
          and white striped armband on his left arm, along with special sniper
          goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular goggles that he
          sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper
          goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his
          sniper goggles were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash
          and no shirt underneath. He also carries with him a yellow satchel,
          which he stores all his tools and gadgets in.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          After the two year timeskip, Usopp has become much more muscular than
          before and has grown his hair out. He has become "manlier" and is
          slightly taller than before. Usopp now has a new pair of goggles
          around his neck (his sniper goggles weren't shown) and has some
          headphones or ear protectors on. He also now has a little goatee along
          with a new white suncap he wears on his head. He also has a new pair
          of rolled-up yellow pants with red suspenders and a pair of boots.

        <h2>
          "Black Leg" Sanji,born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw Hat
          Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join,
          doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus
          making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his
          family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as
          an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually
          entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he
          would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join
          his crew.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Sanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he
          keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was
          the left side. After the two year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle
          so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's hair is
          less straight and scruffier after the timeskip.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Among Sanji's physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form
          a spiral but at different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at
          the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end.
          His eyebrows curl in the opposite direction from his siblings, whose
          eyebrows curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e to the left side).
          Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction

        <h2>
          Monkey D. Luffy, also known as " Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as
          "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One
          Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and
          powerful Straw Hat Pirates as well as one of its top fighters, and
          currently one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. His
          lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary
          treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being
          the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at
          age 7, which turned his body into rubber. He met "Red-Haired" Shanks,
          who gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature
          accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them
          to meet again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader
          Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the
          sworn brother of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary
          Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of
          the few people in the world who carries the Will of D. During the
          climax of the Raid on Onigashima, his Devil Fruit abilities truly
          awakened for the first time since the Void Century; bestowing him with
          Mythical power that the World Government greatly feared would return.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          After those two years, a few things have changed. Luffy wears an open,
          long-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons (which shows the X-shaped
          scar covering most of his chest he received by then-Admiral
          Akainu).with a yellow sash tied around his waist, somewhat reminiscent
          of Gol D. Roger's outfit. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to
          be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen
          in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids,

          She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined

          after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make
          a map of the entire world.

        <h2>
          From the Return to Sabaody Arc through the Fish-Man Island Arc, Nami's
          hair has grown rather long, which reaches her lower back. A single
          long hair stand hanging on the left side with bangs still hanging over
          her forehead. Her breasts have also grown much larger/rounder similar
          to Nico Robin's, but apart from this, her appearance has not changed
          much, save for the fact that both her body curves and hourglass figure
          have become more pronounced.

          Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to
          reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will.
          As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is
          currently one of only two people in the world known to have the
          ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered

          president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename
          "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before
          joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which
          tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.

          She has no trademark looks like the others, though her all-purple
          cowgirl look from when she was first introduced is often associated as
          her trademark look. Like Nami, Robin seems to be fond of revealing
          outfits as she is frequently wearing clothing that are either dark in
          color (often black or purple) or consists of leather (sometimes both).
          She is also fond of high heels and they do not seem to affect the way
          she walks or her speed.
